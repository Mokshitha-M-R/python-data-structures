# Python Data Structures (Conceptual Explanation)

## Introduction
Python data structures are built-in tools that help store, organize, and manage data efficiently. They allow programmers to work with multiple values easily and write clear, readable code. Understanding data structures is essential for solving real-world problems using Python.

## Key Concepts
- **List** – An ordered and mutable collection of elements.
- **Tuple** – An ordered but immutable collection of values.
- **Set** – An unordered collection that stores only unique elements.
- **Dictionary** – A collection of key–value pairs used for fast data access.
- **String** – A sequence of characters used to represent text.

## Simple Syntax Examples
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
coordinates = (10, 20)
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
student = {"name": "Student", "age": 20}
